## About Me

I wanted to understand the world.
So in school I took every science class available to me: your standard biology and chemistry courses, and also classical mechanics, astronomy and astrophysics, and then later, electromagnetism, special and general relativity, and quantum mechanics.

I came to realize that if you want to understand anything, underneath it all, all there is, is mathematics.
So I became a mathematician, and studied and understood things no one else had ever understood before.
With time and effort I gained the intuition to think rigorously about "polyfolds"---abstract infinite-dimensional spaces allowing for degenerative "bubbling" phenomena.
Using the methods and techniques of polyfold theory, for nearly a decade, I worked on a complete and rigorous proof of the Gromov--Witten axioms.
My research was ultimately successful in solving this problem completely and in full generality.
Thanks in part to my own work, there are very few interesting and tractable problems that remain in my sphere of mathematical expertise.

My interest has turned towards the technologies of our modern age.
To me, the best way to keep abreast of new technological developments which have the power and promise to change the world is to fully understand them myself.
Although I gladly leave the world of mathematics behind, the fact remains---mathematics is underneath everything!
