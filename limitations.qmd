Some years ago, at one of the UC Berkeley afternoon teas I was speaking with a colleague of mine.
He had just returned from a conference on "New Developments in Microlocal Sheaf Theory" (or something along those lines, I do not remember this precisely).
What I do remember, vividly, is his description of a fascinating encounter.
At the conference was a child, only 12-year-old, a rising prodigy in algebraic geometry, surrounded by people at least double his age.
The colleague was naturally intrigued, and did his best to converse with the kid.

"It was the strangest thing. He seemed to know the entirety of Hartshorne's _Algebraic Geometry_ by heart. He could rattle of the exact statement of, for example, the _Lemma of Hironaka_ if you asked him."

"But there was no understanding of the meaning behind the words. I have no doubt he was a bright kid, with potential, so no offense by any means. But memorizing a theorem is not the same as understanding it."

The above story presents a dichotomy, that of _knowing_ vs. _understanding_.
When we evaluate the capabilities and potential of modern Artificial Intelligence amidst the endless hype, we really ought to keep this fundamental contrast in mind.

## The conventional wisdom: AI mathematicians are imminent

<!-- Some Predictions of imminent AI mathematicians -->

Is automation and economic disruption, long a concern for blue collar factory workers, coming for the jobs of academic mathematicians?
According to the conventional wisdom, Artificial Intelligence will someday soon replace humans for all information-related tasks.
Pointedly, this supposedly includes mathematics, ranging from simple calculations to Putnam and IMO problems to research level mathematics.

The New York Times informs us that [A.I. Is Coming for Mathematics, Too](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/02/science/ai-mathematics-machine-learning.html), and suggests that the deductive jumps of reasoning required by mathematics are already being replicated by the impenetrable black boxes of neural networks.
In an anecdote, a neural network is described as managing to correctly predict some desired mathematical constant, but unable to further elaborate or explain its conclusion: "the neural net had somehow intuitively discerned a mathematical truth, but the logical 'why' of it was far from obvious".
Inspection of the layers of the neural network proved predictably fruitless.

The Fields medalist Terrence Tao describes his own [experience](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/113132503432772494) toying with GPT-4 as being "roughly on par with trying to advise a mediocre, but not completely incompetent, (static simulation of a) graduate student"; given a complex analysis problem, and with hints and prodding, it was able to give an accurate proof.

Entering the realm of science-fiction, the prominent computer scientist and artificial intelligence researcher Christian Szegedy optimistically predicts that by June 2026 we will see ["super-human mathematician AI"](https://x.com/chrszegedy/status/1759050899291598956?mx=2).

However.

Despite the breathless hype.

## The (current) reality: AI cannot reliably solve math problems

<!-- at the moment, are ill-suited to discovering new mathematics -->

Playing around with any of the top of the line chatbots, it is easy to be initially impressed.
They can convincingly (and correctly) compute a complicated integral requiring complex analysis, or even write a proof of Weinstein's neighborhood theorem!

Playing around a little more, it isn't hard at all for chatbots to produce gibberish; responses usually contain horrific basic arithmetical errors, hallucinations of connections between unrelated concepts, or unconditional overconfidence in the veracity of the given answer. (See the next sections for some illustrative experiments!)

So, are chatbots right now deducing the answers using logic and reasoning, arriving at the answer deductive step by deductive step?
Or are they regurgitating tweaked answers they have seen before, after ingesting the world's online libraries?
OpenAI's research LLM, o1-preview, showed a [30% drop in accuracy](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YXnwlZe0yf) on a benchmark based on Putnam competition problems simply by tweaking the given questions.

When evaluating the mathematical capabilities of LLMs, it is helpful to have a bit of an understanding for how modern LLMs actually work.

# Microsoft Copilot factors the number $12$

**Prompt:** List all the ways three distinct integers have a product of 12

`Microsoft Copilot`

> We're looking for sets of three distinct integers whose product equals 12. Let's find all possible combinations:
>
> - 1 × 2 × 6 = 12
> - 1 × 3 × 4 = 12
> - (−1) × (−2) × 6 = 12
> - (−1) × (−3) × 4 = 12
> - (−2) × (−3) × (-2) = 12 (Here, I swapped -1 and -3 but it still remains a valid distinct set)
>
> So, the unique sets of three distinct integers whose product is 12 are (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 4), (-1, -2, 6), (-1, -3, 4), (-2, -3, -2).
>
> Mathematical puzzles can be such a treasure trove of logical thinking! What's your next brain teaser?

The actual answer is:

$$
\begin{align}
&(-3, -1, 4),\ (-12, -1, 1),\ (1, 2, 6),\ (-6, -2, 1),\ (-4, -1, 3), \\
&(1, 3, 4),\ (-4, -3, 1),\ (-3, -2, 2),\ (-6, -1, 2),\ (-2, -1, 6)
\end{align}
$$

A few things stand out about copilots answer:

- it has difficulty handling edge cases, such as $(-12,-1,1)$,
- it is not very systematic in terms of indentifying distinct triplets,
- it is hillariously bad at checking its answer; note that the last triplet $(-2,-3,-2)$ satisfies neither condition; $-2$ is repeated and the product is of course $-12$.

Everywhere you look there is a basic error, by my count, at least $4$.
Conceptually, the most egregious is the attempted factorization by a noninteger, $3703 = 71 × 52.15...$, followed immediately by listing $71$ as a prime factor.

(The actual factorization is
$600851475143 = 71 \times 839 \times 1471 \times 6857$
so the answer to the prompt is $839$.)

# Google Gemini and Function Preimages

<!-- > We call a positive integer **double pandigital** if it uses all the digits 0 to 9 exactly twice (with no leading zero). For example, 40561817703823564929 is one such number. How many double pandigital numbers are divisible by 3? -->

<!-- To be divisible by 3, a number's digit sum must be divisible by 3. -->

<!-- A double pandigital number has each digit from 0 to 9 twice, so its digit sum is: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- 2 * (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) = 2 * 45 = 90 -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Since 90 is divisible by 3, **all double pandigital numbers are divisible by 3**. -->

<!-- Therefore, to find the number of double pandigital numbers, we just need to find the total number of ways to arrange 10 digits twice, ensuring no leading zero. -->

<!-- There are 9 choices for the first digit (since it can't be 0), then 10 choices for each of the remaining 19 digits. So, the total number of double pandigital numbers is: -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- 9 * 10^{19} = 9,000,000,000,000,000,000 -->

**Prompt:** Prove that $f(f^{-1}(A)) = A$.

I gave this problem to some students in an intro math course. In the process of trying to probe possible approaches for a proof, they produced an instructive, and obvious, counterexample: $$f: \{0\} \to \{0,1\},\ f(0)=0,\ A=\{0,1\}.$$

# ChatGPT-4 and the Kontsevich Recursion Formula

**Prompt:** Let d $\geq$ 1. How many degree $d$ rational curves in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ pass through $3d - 1$ points in general position?

`ChatGPT-4`

> To determine the number of degree $d$ rational curves in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ that pass through $3d - 1$ points in general position, we can use the theory of intersection numbers and rational curves in projective spaces.
>
> ### Step 1: Understanding Rational Curves
>
> A rational curve of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ can be represented by a map $\mathbb{CP}^1 \to \mathbb{CP}^2$ that has degree $d$. Such curves can be thought of as the images of a rational parameterization of degree $d$.
>

This question was mostly just for fun, to see what kind of answer ChatGPT-4 would give to a question of fundamental importance in enumerative geometry, and which I understand deeply and completely.
And indeed, ChatGPT-4's answer is a confidently stated hallucination, disconnected with any sort of mathematical reality.

The correct answer is given by the initial condition $N_1 = 1$ and by the recursion formula:

$$
N_d = \sum_{k+l = d} N_k\cdot N_l \cdot
\left(
k^2\cdot l^2 \cdot \binom{3d-4}{3k-2}
- k^3\cdot l \cdot \binom{3d-4}{3k-1}
\right)
$$

The proof rests upon the enumerative foundations provided by the Gromov--Witten axioms.
An understanding of the **splitting axiom**, the **divisor axiom**, and the **fundamental class axiom** are necessary to derive the above recursive formula.
