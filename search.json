    "text": "A neural network is just a mathematical function. In the most standard kind of neural network, the function:\nThis represents one “layer”. Then these three steps are repeated, using the outputs of the previous layer as the inputs to the next layer. Initially, the parameters in this function are selected randomly. Therefore a newly created neural network doesn’t do anything useful at all – it’s just random!\nTo get the function to “learn” to do something useful, we have to change the parameters to make them “better” in some way. We do this using gradient descent. Let’s see how this works…\n::: {#c62a043f .cell _kg_hide-input=‘true’ execution=‘{“iopub.execute_input”:“2023-04-26T12:37:19.419937Z”,“iopub.status.busy”:“2023-04-26T12:37:19.419421Z”,“iopub.status.idle”:“2023-04-26T12:37:22.523175Z”,“shell.execute_reply”:“2023-04-26T12:37:22.522149Z”}’ papermill=‘{“duration”:3.158556,“end_time”:“2023-04-26T12:37:22.525730”,“exception”:false,“start_time”:“2023-04-26T12:37:19.367174”,“status”:“completed”}’ tags=‘[]’ execution_count=1}\n:::\nTo learn how gradient descent works, we’re going to start by fitting a quadratic, since that’s a function most of us are probably more familiar with than a neural network. Here’s the quadratic we’re going to try to fit:\ndef f(x): return 3*x**2 + 2*x + 1\n\nplot_function(f, \"$3x^2 + 2x + 1$\")\nThis quadratic is of the form \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), with parameters \\(a=3\\), \\(b=2\\), \\(c=1\\). To make it easier to try out different quadratics for fitting a model to the data we’ll create, let’s create a function that calculates the value of a point on any quadratic:\ndef quad(a, b, c, x): return a*x**2 + b*x + c\nIf we fix some particular values of a, b, and c, then we’ll have made a quadratic. To fix values passed to a function in python, we use the partial function, like so:\ndef mk_quad(a,b,c): return partial(quad, a,b,c)\nSo for instance, we can recreate our previous quadratic:\nf2 = mk_quad(3,2,1)\nplot_function(f2)\nNow let’s simulate making some noisy measurements of our quadratic f. We’ll then use gradient descent to see if we can recreate the original function from the data.\nHere’s a couple of functions to add some random noise to data:\ndef noise(x, scale): return np.random.normal(scale=scale, size=x.shape)\ndef add_noise(x, mult, add): return x * (1+noise(x,mult)) + noise(x,add)\nLet’s use the now to create our noisy measurements based on the quadratic above:\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\nx = torch.linspace(-2, 2, steps=20)[:,None]\ny = add_noise(f(x), 0.15, 1.5)\nHere’s the first few values of each of x and y:\nx[:5],y[:5]\n\n(tensor([[-2.0000],\n         [-1.7895],\n         [-1.5789],\n         [-1.3684],\n         [-1.1579]]),\n tensor([[11.8690],\n         [ 6.5433],\n         [ 5.9396],\n         [ 2.6304],\n         [ 1.7947]], dtype=torch.float64))\nAs you can see, they’re tensors. A tensor is just like an array in numpy (if you’re not familiar with numpy, I strongly recommend reading this great book, because it’s a critical foundation for nearly all numeric programming in Python. Furthermore, PyTorch, which most researchers use for deep learning, is modeled closely on numpy.) A tensor can be a single number (a scalar or rank-0 tensor), a list of numbers (a vector or rank-1 tensor), a table of numbers (a matrix or rank-2 tensor), a table of tables of numbers (a rank-3 tensor), and so forth.\nWe’re not going to learn much about our data by just looking at the raw numbers, so let’s draw a picture:\nplt.scatter(x,y);\nHow do we find values of a, b, and c which fit this data? One approach is to try a few values and see what fits. Here’s a function which overlays a quadratic on top of our data, along with some sliders to change a, b, and c, and see how it looks:\n@interact(a=1.1, b=1.1, c=1.1)\ndef plot_quad(a, b, c):\n    plt.scatter(x,y)\n    plot_function(mk_quad(a,b,c), ylim=(-3,13))\nReminder: If the sliders above aren’t working for you, that’s because the interactive features of this notebook don’t work in Kaggle’s Reader mode. They only work in Edit mode. Please click “Copy & Edit” in the top right of this window, then in the menu click Run and then Run all. Then you’ll be able to use all the interactive sliders in this notebook.\nTry moving slider a a bit to the left. Does that look better or worse? How about if you move it a bit to the right? Find out which direction seems to improve the fit of the quadratic to the data, and move the slider a bit in that direction. Next, do the same for slider b: first figure out which direction improves the fit, then move it a bit in that direction. Then do the same for c.\nOK, now go back to slider a and repeat the process. Do it again for b and c as well.\nDid you notice that by going back and doing the sliders a second time that you were able to improve things a bit further? That’s an important insight – it’s only after changing b and c, for instance, that you realise that a actually needs some adjustment based on those new values.\nOne thing that’s making this tricky is that we don’t really have a great sense of whether our fit is really better or worse. It would be easier if we had a numeric measure of that. On easy metric we could use is mean absolute error – which is the distance from each data point to the curve:\ndef mae(preds, acts): return (torch.abs(preds-acts)).mean()\nWe’ll update our interactive function to print this at the top for us.\nUse this to repeat the approach we took before to try to find the best fit, but this time just use the value of the metric to decide which direction to move each slider, and how far to move it.\nThis time around, try doing it in the opposite order: c, then b, then a.\nYou’ll probably find that you have to go through the set of sliders a couple of times to get the best fit.\n@interact(a=1.1, b=1.1, c=1.1)\ndef plot_quad(a, b, c):\n    f = mk_quad(a,b,c)\n    plt.scatter(x,y)\n    loss = mae(f(x), y)\n    plot_function(f, ylim=(-3,12), title=f\"MAE: {loss:.2f}\")\nIn a modern neural network we’ll often have tens of millions of parameters to fit, or more, and thousands or millions of data points to fit them to. We’re not going to be able to do that by moving sliders around! We’ll need to automate this process.\nThankfully, that turns out to be pretty straightforward. We can use calculus to figure out, for each parameter, whether we should increase or decrease it.\nUh oh, calculus! If you haven’t touched calculus since school, you might be getting ready to run away at this point. But don’t worry, we don’t actually need much calculus at all. Just derivatives, which measure the rate of change of a function. We don’t even need to calculate them ourselves, because the computer will do it for us! If you’ve forgotten what a derivitive is, then watch the first three of these fantastic videos by Professor Dave. It’s only 15 minutes in total, so give it a go! Then come back here and we’ll continue on our journey…"

    "text": "Automating gradient descent\nThe basic idea is this: if we know the gradient of our mae() function with respect to our parameters, a, b, and c, then that means we know how adjusting (for instance) a will change the value of mae(). If, say, a has a negative gradient, then we know that increasing a will decrease mae(). Then we know that’s what we need to do, since we trying to make mae() as low as possible.\nSo, we find the gradient of mae() for each of our parameters, and then adjust our parameters a bit in the opposite direction to the sign of the gradient.\nTo do this, first we need a function that takes all the parameters a, b, and c as a single vector input, and returns the value mae() based on those parameters:\n\ndef quad_mae(params):\n    f = mk_quad(*params)\n    return mae(f(x), y)\n\nLet’s try it:\n\nquad_mae([1.1, 1.1, 1.1])\n\ntensor(2.4219, dtype=torch.float64)\n\n\nYup, that’s the same as the starting mae() we had in our plot before.\nWe’re first going to do exactly the same thing as we did manually – pick some arbritrary starting point for our parameters. We’ll put them all into a single tensor:\n\nabc = torch.tensor([1.1,1.1,1.1])\n\nTo tell PyTorch that we want it to calculate gradients for these parameters, we need to call requires_grad_():\n\nabc.requires_grad_()\n\ntensor([1.1000, 1.1000, 1.1000], requires_grad=True)\n\n\nWe can now calculate mae(). Generally, when doing gradient descent, the thing we’re trying to minimise is called the loss:\n\nloss = quad_mae(abc)\nloss\n\ntensor(2.4219, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=&lt;MeanBackward0&gt;)\n\n\nTo get PyTorch to now calculate the gradients, we need to call backward()\n\nloss.backward()\n\nThe gradients will be stored for us in an attribute called grad:\n\nabc.grad\n\ntensor([-1.3529, -0.0316, -0.5000])\n\n\nAccording to these gradients, all our parameters are a little low. So let’s increase them a bit. If we subtract the gradient, multiplied by a small number, that should improve them a bit:\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n    \nprint(f'loss={loss:.2f}')\n\nloss=2.40\n\n\nYes, our loss has gone down!\nThe “small number” we multiply is called the learning rate, and is the most important hyper-parameter to set when training a neural network.\nBTW, you’ll see we had to wrap our calculation of the new parameters in with torch.no_grad(). That disables the calculation of gradients for any operations inside that context manager. We have to do that, because abc -= abc.grad*0.01 isn’t actually part of our quadratic model, so we don’t want derivitives to include that calculation.\nWe can use a loop to do a few more iterations of this:\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    loss = quad_mae(abc)\n    loss.backward()\n    with torch.no_grad(): abc -= abc.grad*0.01\n    print(f'step={i}; loss={loss:.2f}')\n\nstep=0; loss=2.40\nstep=1; loss=2.36\nstep=2; loss=2.30\nstep=3; loss=2.21\nstep=4; loss=2.11\nstep=5; loss=1.98\nstep=6; loss=1.85\nstep=7; loss=1.72\nstep=8; loss=1.58\nstep=9; loss=1.46\n\n\nAs you can see, our loss keeps going down!\nIf you keep running this loop for long enough however, you’ll see that the loss eventually starts increasing for a while. That’s because once the parameters get close to the correct answer, our parameter updates will jump right over the correct answer! To avoid this, we need to decrease our learning rate as we train. This is done using a learning rate schedule, and can be automated in most deep learning frameworks, such as fastai and PyTorch."

    "section": "How a neural network approximates any given function",
    "text": "How a neural network approximates any given function\nBut neural nets are much more convenient and powerful than this example showed, because we can learn much more than just a quadratic with them. How does that work?\nThe trick is that a neural network is a very expressive function. In fact – it’s infinitely expressive. A neural network can approximate any computable function, given enough parameters. A “computable function” can cover just about anything you can imagine: understand and translate human speech; paint a picture; diagnose a disease from medical imaging; write an essay; etc…\nThe way a neural network approximates a function actually turns out to be very simple. The key trick is to combine two extremely basic steps:\n\nMatrix multiplication, which is just multiplying things together and then adding them up\nThe function \\(max(x,0)\\), which simply replaces all negative numbers with zero.\n\nIn PyTorch, the function \\(max(x,0)\\) is written as np.clip(x,0). The combination of a linear function and this max() is called a rectified linear function, and it can be implemented like this:\n\ndef rectified_linear(m,b,x):\n    y = m*x+b\n    return torch.clip(y, 0.)\n\nHere’s what it looks like:\n\nplot_function(partial(rectified_linear, 1,1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW, instead of torch.clip(y, 0.), we can instead use F.relu(x), which does exactly the same thing. In PyTorch, F refers to the torch.nn.functional module.\n\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\ndef rectified_linear2(m,b,x): return F.relu(m*x+b)\nplot_function(partial(rectified_linear2, 1,1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand how this function works, try using this interactive version to play around with the parameters m and b:\n\n@interact(m=1.5, b=1.5)\ndef plot_relu(m, b):\n    plot_function(partial(rectified_linear, m,b), ylim=(-1,4))\n\n\n\n\nAs you see, m changes the slope, and b changes where the “hook” appears. This function doesn’t do much on its own, but look what happens when we add two of them together:\n\ndef double_relu(m1,b1,m2,b2,x):\n    return rectified_linear(m1,b1,x) + rectified_linear(m2,b2,x)\n\n@interact(m1=-1.5, b1=-1.5, m2=1.5, b2=1.5)\ndef plot_double_relu(m1, b1, m2, b2):\n    plot_function(partial(double_relu, m1,b1,m2,b2), ylim=(-1,6))\n\n\n\n\nIf you play around with that for a while, you notice something quite profound: with enough of these rectified linear functions added together, you could approximate any function with a single input, to whatever accuracy you like! Any time the function doesn’t quite match, you can just add a few more additions to the mix to make it a bit closer. As an experiment, perhaps you’d like to try creating your own plot_triple_relu interactive function, and maybe even include the scatter plot of our data from before, to see how close you can get?\nThis exact same approach can be expanded to functions of 2, 3, or more parameters."

    "text": "How to recognise an owl\nOK great, we’ve created a nifty little example showing that we can drawing squiggly lines that go through some points. So what?\nWell… the truth is that actually drawing squiggly lines (or planes, or high-dimensional hyperplanes…) through some points is literally all that deep learning does! If your data points are, say, the RGB values of pixels in photos of owls, then you can create an owl-recogniser model by following the exact steps above.\nThis may, at first, sound about as useful as the classic “how to draw an owl” guide:\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nStudents often ask me at this point “OK Jeremy, but how do neural nets actually work”. But at a foundational level, there is no “step 2”. We’re done – the above steps will, given enough time and enough data, create (for example) an owl recogniser, if you feed in enough owls (and non-owls).\nThe devil, I guess, is in the “given enough time and enough data” part of the above sentence. There’s a lot of tweaks we can make to reduce both of these things. For instance, instead of running our calculations on a normal CPU, as we’ve done above, we could do thousands of them simultaneously by taking advantage of a GPU. We could greatly reduce the amount of computation and data needed by using a convolution instead of a matrix multiplication, which basically means skipping over a bunch of the multiplications and additions for bits that you’d guess won’t be important. We could make things much faster if, instead of starting with random parameters, we start with parameters of someone else’s model that does something similar to what we want (this is called transfer learning).\nAnd, of course, there’s lots of helpful software out there to do this stuff for you without too much fuss. Like, say, fastai.\nLearning these things is what we teach in our course, which, like everything we make, is totally free. So if you’re interested in learning more, do check it out!\nAs always, if you enjoyed this notebook, please upvote it to help others find it, and to encourage me to write more.

What I do remember, vividly, is his description of a fascinating encounter. At the conference was a child, only 12-year-old, a rising prodigy in algebraic geometry, surrounded by people at least double his age. The colleague was naturally intrigued, and did his best to converse with the kid.\n“It was the strangest thing. He seemed to know the entirety of Hartshorne’s Algebraic Geometry by heart. He could rattle of the exact statement of, for example, the Lemma of Hironaka if you asked him.”\n“But there was no understanding of the meaning behind the words. I have no doubt he was a bright kid, with potential, so no offense by any means. But memorizing a theorem is not the same as understanding it.”\nThe above story presents a dichotomy, that of knowing vs. understanding. When we evaluate the capabilities and potential of modern Artificial Intelligence amidst the endless hype, we really ought to keep this fundamental contrast in mind."

    "text": "History of the Gromov–Witten axioms\nIn 1985 Gromov published the paper “Pseudo holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds”, laying the foundations for the modern study of pseudo holomorphic curves (also know as \\(J\\)-holomorphic curves) in symplectic topology (Gromov 1985). In this paper, Gromov proved a compactness result for the moduli space of \\(J\\)-holomorphic curves in a fixed homology class. This paper contained antecedents to the modern notion of the Gromov–Witten invariants in the proofs of the nonsqueezing theorem and the uniqueness of symplectic structures on \\(\\mathbb{C}P^2\\).\nAround 1988, inspired by Floer’s study of gauge theory on three manifolds, Witten introduced the topological sigma model (Floer 1988; Witten 1988). The invariants of this model are the “\\(k\\)-point correlation functions”, another precursor to the modern notion of the Gromov–Witten invariants. Witten also observed some of the relationships between these invariants and possible degenerations of Riemann surfaces (Witten 1991). Further precursors to the notion of the Gromov–Witten invariants can also be seen in McDuff’s classification of symplectic ruled surfaces (McDuff 1991).\nIn 1993 Ruan gave a modern definition of the genus-zero Gromov–Witten invariants for semipositive symplectic manifolds (Ruan 1996, 1994). At the end of 1993, Ruan and Tian established the associativity of the quantum product for semipositive symplectic manifolds, giving a mathematical basis to the composition law of Witten’s topological sigma model (Ruan and Tian 1995).\nIn 1994 Kontsevich and Manin stated the Gromov–Witten axioms, given as a list of formal relations between the Gromov–Witten invariants (Kontsevich and Manin 1994). At the time it was not possible for Kontsevich and Manin to give a proof of the relations they listed; the definition of the Gromov–Witten invariant (complete with homology classes from a Deligne–Mumford space) would require in addition new ideas involving “stable maps” (Kontsevich 1995). Hence they used to term “axiom” with the presumed meaning “to take for assumption without proof”/ “to use as a premise for further reasoning”. And indeed, from these starting assumptions they were able to establish foundational results in enumerative geometry, answers to esoteric questions such as:\n\nKontsevich’s recursion formula. Let \\(d\\geq 1\\). How many degree \\(d\\) rational curves in \\(\\mathbb{C}P^2\\) pass through \\(3d - 1\\) points in general position?\n\nMoreover, in this paper they outlined some of the formal consequences of the axioms by demonstrating how to combine the invariants into a Gromov–Witten potential, and interpret the axioms as differential equations which the potential satisfies.\nTo varying extents, this work has predated the construction of a well-defined Gromov–Witten invariant in symplectic geometry for \\(J\\)-holomorphic curves of arbitrary genus, and for all closed symplectic manifolds. Efforts to construct a well-defined Gromov–Witten invariant constitute an ever growing list of publications, including but not limited to the following: (Li and Tian 1998; Fukaya and Ono 1999; Fukaya et al. 2012; Siebert 1996; Cieliebak and Mohnke 2007; McDuff and Wehrheim 2012, 2018, 2017; Ionel and Parker 2013; Pardon 2016). A discussion of some of the difficulties inherent in these approaches can be found in (Fabert et al. 2016). Similarly, there have been several efforts to prove the Gromov–Witten axioms (Fukaya and Ono 1999; McDuff and Salamon 2012; Castellano 2016).\nOver the past two decades, Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder have developed a new approach to resolving transversality issues that arise in the study of \\(J\\)-holomorphic curves in symplectic geometry called polyfold theory (Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder 2007, 2009a, 2009b, 2017a, 2010b, n.d., 2010a, 2017b). This approach has been successful in constructing a well-defined Gromov–Witten invariant for arbitrary genus and for general symplectic manifolds (Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder 2017a).\nWith a fully general Gromov–Witten invariant finally defined rigorously, my research has fixated on answering the following question:\n\nIs it finally possible to prove the Gromov–Witten axioms by using polyfold theory?"

More structure is needed."

    "text": "The classical pseudocycle Gromov–Witten invariant\nThe classical approach to defining the Gromov–Witten invariants is to show that the Gromov–Witten moduli space has the structure of a pseudocycle.\nIf the Cauchy–Riemann section were completely transversal to the zero section, i.e., transversal when considered on all possible nodal strata of the space of \\(J\\)-curves, then the top stratum of the space of \\(J\\)-curves would have the structure of a finite-dimensional manifold and all nodal strata would have the structure of manifolds with codimension at least \\(2\\) relative to the top stratum. Thus the space of \\(J\\)-curves would have the structure of a “pseudocycle”, i.e., a space whose boundary (the nodal strata) would be invisible from the point of view of homology.\nDefinition. Let \\(M\\) be a smooth manifold. A smooth map \\(f: V \\to M\\) is a \\(d\\)-dimensional pseudocycle if \\(V\\) is an oriented \\(d\\)-dimensional manifold \\(V\\) such that the image \\(f(V)\\) has compact closure and such that the image of the boundary \\(f(\\bar{V} \\setminus V)\\) has dimension at most \\(\\leq d - 2\\).\nPseudocycles have sufficient structure for defining intersection numbers, as for dimension reasons the boundary will not contribute to the intersection number.\nHowever, transversality of the Cauchy–Riemann section is often impossible to obtain through classical techniques, i.e., perturbation of an almost complex structure. As a consequence, the nodal strata may have dimension larger than expected—indeed, larger than the dimension of the top stratum. This situation is a fundamental obstacle to the rigorous definition of a Gromov–Witten invariant; after all, for dimension reasons, any (nonzero) contribution to the intersection number from such a nodal stratum with large dimension would no longer be finite.\nThe pseudocycle approach to defining Gromov–Witten invariants deals with this difficulty by imposing strict conditions on the symplectic manifold which disallows such phenomena in the nodal strata. The “semipositive” condition was first introduced by McDuff in 1991 in (McDuff 1991): a symplectic manifold \\((M^{2n},\\omega)\\) is called semipositive if, for every \\(A\\in \\pi_2(M)\\),\n\\[\n    \\omega(A) &gt;0,\\ c_1(A) \\geq 3-n \\quad \\implies \\quad c_1(A) \\geq 0.\n\\]\nThis condition may seem ad-hoc, but it is specifically designed to guarantee that in the genus-zero case, the strata of nodal \\(J\\)-curves will have codimension at least \\(2\\) relative to the dimension of the top stratum of non-noded simple \\(J\\)-curves.\nTheorem. (McDuff and Salamon 2012, Thms. 6.6.1, 6.7.1) Let \\((M,\\omega)\\) be a semipositive sympletic manifold. There exists a regular almost complex structure on \\(M\\) such that the evaluation map from the genus-zero Gromov–Witten moduli space to the product \\(M\\times \\cdots \\times M,\\)\n\\[\n    ev: \\bar{\\mathcal{M}}_{A,0,k}(J) \\to M\\times\\cdots\\times M,\n\\]\nis a pseudocycle.\nThe pseudocycle Gromov–Witten invariant is the homomorphism\n\\[\n    \\text{pseudocycle-}\\mathop{\\mathrm{GW}}_{A,0,k} : H_* (M;{\\mathbb Q})^{\\otimes k} \\to {\\mathbb Q}\n\\]\ndefined via the intersection number of the pseudocycle \\(ev : {\\mathcal M}^*_{A,0,k} (J) \\to M\\times\\cdots\\times M\\) with a basis of representing submanifolds \\({\\mathcal X}\\subset M\\):\n\\[\n    \\text{pseudocycle-}\\mathop{\\mathrm{GW}}_{A,0,k} ([{\\mathcal X}_1],\\ldots,[{\\mathcal X}_k]) :=\n    ev({{\\mathcal M}^*_{A,0,k}(J)}) \\cdot \\left({\\mathcal X}_1 \\times\\cdots\\times {\\mathcal X}_k \\right).\n\\]\nThe invariant does not depend on the choice of regular almost complex structure \\(J\\), nor on the choice of representing basis."

We may furthermore construct a “strong polyfold bundle” \\({\\mathcal W}_{A,g,k}\\) over \\({\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k}\\); the Cauchy–Riemann operator then defines a “scale smooth Fredholm section” of this bundle, \\(\\bar{\\partial}_J:{\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k} \\to {\\mathcal W}_{A,g,k}\\), such that \\(\\smash{\\bar{\\partial}_J}\\vphantom{\\partial}^{-1}(0) = \\bar{\\mathcal{M}}_{A,g,k}(J)\\). We can construct “abstract perturbations” \\(p\\) of this section such that \\(\\bar{\\partial}_J+p\\) is transverse to the zero section and such that \\((\\bar{\\partial}_J+p)^{-1}(0)\\) is a compact set. In this way, we may take a scale smooth Fredholm section and “regularize” the unperturbed Gromov–Witten moduli space yielding a perturbed Gromov–Witten moduli space \\({\\mathcal S}_{A,g,k}(p):= (\\bar{\\partial}_J+p)^{-1}(0)\\) which has the structure of a compact oriented “weighted branched orbifold”.\n\\[\n        \\begin{array}{c}\n        \\bar{\\mathcal{M}}_{A,g,k}(J) = \\bar{\\partial}_J^{-1}(0)        \\\\\n        \\text{\\small{compact topological space}} \\\\\n        \\end{array}\n        \\xrightarrow{\\text{``polyfold regularization''}}\n        \\begin{array}{c}\n            {\\mathcal S}_{A,g,k}(p):=(\\bar{\\partial}_J+p)^{-1}(0) \\\\\n            \\text{\\small{compact ``weighted branched orbifold''}}\n        \\end{array}\n\\]\nThis approach has been successful in giving a well-defined Gromov–Witten invariant for curves of arbitrary genus, and for all closed symplectic manifolds.\nConsider homology classes \\(\\alpha_1,\\ldots, \\alpha_k \\in H_* (M;{\\mathbb Q})\\) and \\(\\beta\\in H_* (\\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k};{\\mathbb Q})\\).

Aided by the modern language of ep-groupoids, I was able to follow the same approach as Thom and obtain the following analogue for orbifolds.\nTheorem (Schmaltz 2019a, The Steenrod problem for orbifolds) The rational homology groups of a closed orientable orbifold have a basis consisting of classes represented by “closed embedded full suborbifolds whose normal bundles have fiberwise trivial isotropy action”.\nIn other words, given a closed orientable orbifold \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) there exists a basis \\(\\{[\\mathcal{X}_i]\\}\\) of the rational homology groups \\(H_*(\\mathcal{O};\\mathbb{Q})\\) which consists of the fundamental classes of such “closed embedded full suborbifolds \\(\\mathcal{X}_i\\subset \\mathcal{O}\\) whose normal bundles have fiberwise trivial isotropy action”. Such a suborbifold is called a representing suborbifold.\nRepresenting suborbifolds are well-suited for general intersection theories. Given such a suborbifold, the underlying topological space of the normal bundle is a vector bundle over the underlying topological space of the suborbifold. In contrast, the underlying topological space of an arbitrary orbifold bundle will generally not be a vector bundle. This means it is possible to use single valued sections (as opposed to multisections) for arguments involving perturbations.\n\n\n\nA sketch of the proof of the Steenrod problem for orbifolds, Heidelberg Geometry Seminar, 28 November, 2023"

    "text": "Polyfold Gromov–Witten invariants as intersection numbers\nThe earliest interpretations of the Gromov–Witten invariants present in the literature were given in terms of counting a finite number of curves (McDuff and Salamon 2012; Ruan 1994, 1996). For example, Ruan described the Gromov–Witten invariants as a finite sum, counted with multiplicity, of nonmultiple cover \\(J\\)-spheres in \\({\\mathcal M}^*_{(A,J)}\\) which intersect representatives of given cycles in the symplectic manifold (Ruan 1996, Thm. A).\nHowever, such definitions have previously been restricted to genus zero Gromov–Witten invariants in semipositive symplectic manifolds. Observe that in the genus \\(0\\) case the Grothendieck–Knudsen spaces \\(\\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{0,k}\\) are finite-dimensional manifolds. In contrast, if genus \\(g &gt;0\\) the general Deligne–Mumford spaces \\(\\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k}\\) are orbifolds. Therefore, in the genus \\(0\\) case extant methods—such as representing a homology class as a pseudocycle in a manifold or, indeed, the Steenrod problem for manifolds—were sufficient to interpret the Gromov–Witten invariants as an intersection number.\nUsing the Steenrod problem for orbifolds, I was able to prove that the polyfold Gromov–Witten invariants may equivalently be defined as an intersection number. Let \\({\\mathcal S}_{A,g,k}(p)\\) be a perturbed Gromov–Witten moduli space, and let \\({\\mathcal X}_1\\times \\cdots \\times {\\mathcal X}_k \\times {\\mathcal B}\\) be a representing suborbifold of \\(M^k \\times \\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k}\\).\nI showed that transversality of a perturbed solution space of a polyfold with a representing submanifolds/suborbifolds may always be achieved through either of the following:\n\nThrough the perturbation of the representing suborbifold; due to the properties of the normal bundle representing suborbifolds may always be perturbed (Schmaltz 2019a, Prop. 3.9).\nAssuming the map defined on the ambient polyfold is a submersion, we may obtain transversality through choice of a suitable abstract perturbation (Schmaltz 2019a, Prop. 3.10).\n\nWhen \\(\\dim {\\mathcal S}_{A,g,k}(p) + \\dim \\left({\\mathcal X}_1 \\times\\cdots\\times {\\mathcal X}_k \\times {\\mathcal B}\\right) = \\dim (M^k \\times \\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k})\\) the intersection number is given by the signed weighted count of a finite number of points of intersection.\nTheorem (Schmaltz 2019a, Polyfold Gromov–Witten invariants as intersection numbers) The polyfold Gromov–Witten invariant may equivalently be defined as the intersection number evaluated on a basis of representing submanifolds \\({\\mathcal X}\\subset M\\) and representing suborbifolds \\({\\mathcal B}\\subset {\\mathcal O}\\):\n\\[\n    \\mathop{\\mathrm{GW}}_{A,g,k} ([{\\mathcal X}_1],\\ldots,[{\\mathcal X}_k];[{\\mathcal B}]) :=\n    \\left(ev_1\\times\\cdots\\times ev_k\\times\\pi\\right)|_{{\\mathcal S}_{A,g,k}(p)} \\cdot \\left({\\mathcal X}_1 \\times\\cdots\\times {\\mathcal X}_k \\times {\\mathcal B}\\right).\n\\]\nThe invariant does not depend on the choice of abstract perturbation, nor on the choice of representing basis.\nThus the traditional geometric interpretation of the Gromov–Witten invariants as a “count of curves” is made literal.\n\n\n\nA Gromov–Witten invariant"

    "text": "Difficulties in proving the polyfold Gromov–Witten axioms\nProving this required a substantial amount of work, and relied on the results of (Schmaltz 2019b, 2019a). The Gromov–Witten axioms give relationships between the Gromov–Witten invariants. These relationships are determined by the geometry of certain naturally defined maps defined between the unperturbed Gromov–Witten moduli spaces, namely the permutation maps, the \\(k\\)th-marked point forgetting maps, in addition to certain natural maps which identify marked points into nodal pairs, where the Gromov–Witten moduli space is subject to a diagonal constraint. With the exception of the \\(k\\)th-marked point forgetting maps, we may pullback abstract perturbations in order to obtain well-defined restricted maps between perturbed Gromov–Witten moduli spaces.\nThe branched integral is useful for giving a well-defined definition of the polyfold Gromov–Witten invariants and moreover showing that they are, in fact, invariants and do not depend on choices. But integration is not the best viewpoint for giving a proof of all of the axioms. Intuitively, we should prove the Gromov–Witten axioms by interpreting the Gromov–Witten invariants as an intersection number and using the geometry of the above maps to directly compare such counts with respect to constraints imposed by the homology classes on \\(M\\) and \\(\\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k}\\). And indeed, via (Schmaltz 2019a) this intuition is made rigorous, and is precisely my approach to proving the axioms.\nHowever, problems arise when we try to define a \\(k\\)th-marked point forgetting map between perturbed Gromov–Witten moduli spaces—such a map does not even exist. The construction of the smooth structure for the Deligne–Mumford orbifolds as described in (Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder 2017a) and (Hofer, Wysocki, and Zehnder, n.d.) requires a choice: that of a “gluing profile,” i.e., a smooth diffeomorphism \\(\\varphi: (0,1]\\to [0,\\infty).\\) Given a noded Riemann surface and a nonzero parameter \\(a \\in {\\mathbb C}\\) we use the gluing profile to replace a region of the node with a cylinder of finite length \\(\\varphi(\\lvert a\\rvert)\\). The logarithmic gluing profile is given by \\(\\varphi_{\\log} (r) = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\log (r)\\) and produces the classical holomorphic Deligne–Mumford orbifolds \\(\\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k}\\). There is also an exponential gluing profile, given by \\(\\varphi_{\\exp} (r) = e^{1/r} - e\\) which produces Deligne–Mumford orbifolds \\(\\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{exp}}_{g,k}\\) which are only smooth orbifolds. The exponential gluing profile is required for the scale smoothness of certain maps used to define the Gromov–Witten polyfolds.\nThis use of nonstandard smooth structure has the following consequence:\n\nProblem 1. In general the map \\(ft_k: \\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{exp}}_{g,k} \\to \\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{exp}}_{g,k-1}\\) is continuous but not differentiable.\n\nIndependent of the usage of a nonstandard gluing profile, there is no hope whatsoever of defining a \\(k\\)th-marked point forgetting map on the Gromov–Witten polyfolds as they are defined:\n\nProblem 2. In general there does not exist a natural map \\(ft_k\\) on the Gromov–Witten polyfolds.\n\nTo explain, a stable curve in \\({\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k}\\) may contain a “destabilizing ghost component,” i.e., a component \\(C_k\\simeq S^2\\) with precisely \\(3\\) special points, one of which is the \\(k\\)th-marked point, and such that \\(\\int_{C_k} u^*\\omega=0,\\) \\(u|_{C_k} \\neq\\text{const}.\\) After removal of the \\(k\\)th-marked point from such a component we cannot consider the resulting data as a stable curve in \\({\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k-1}\\).\nWe might try to restrict to a subset \\({\\mathcal Z}^\\text{const}_{A,g,k}\\subset {\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k}\\) consisting of stable curves which are constant on such destabilizing ghost components. The \\(k\\)th-marked point forgetting map is then well-defined on this subset. However, if we consider \\(\\mathcal{Z}^\\text{const}_{A,g,k}\\subset \\mathcal{Z}_{A,g,k}\\) with the subspace topology, and \\(\\mathcal{Z}_{A,g,k-1}\\) with the usual polyfold topology, then:\n\nProblem 3. In general the well-defined restriction \\(ft_k:{\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k}^\\text{const} \\to \\mathcal{Z}_{A,g,k-1}\\) is not continuous.\n\nThere is a final problem. In general, the projection map must factor through the \\(k\\)th-marked point forgetting map; this is due to the need to forget the added stabilizing points. Thus, in order to obtain a smooth projection map we must map to the logarithmic Deligne–Mumford orbifold. However:\n\nProblem 4. While the projection \\(\\pi : {\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k} \\to \\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k}\\) is \\(\\text{sc}\\)-smooth, in general it is not a submersion.\n\nThis has important consequences if we wish to consider the Gromov–Witten invariant as an intersection number; the only way to get transversality of the projection map with a representing suborbifold \\({\\mathcal B}\\subset \\smash{\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}}\\vphantom{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\text{log}}_{g,k}\\) is through perturbation of the suborbifold. This is made possible by the existence of representing suborbifolds, for which perturbation is possible, the existence of which is guaranteed by (Schmaltz 2019a)."

    "text": "The universal curve Gromov–Witten polyfold\nIn essence, the central problem is that the Gromov–Witten polyfolds as constructed are not “universal curves”. My proof of the Gromov–Witten axioms rectifies this by constructing a universal curve polyfold \\({\\mathcal Z}^\\text{uc}_{A,g,k}\\) over \\({\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k-1}\\), on which we may consider a well-defined \\(k\\)th-marked point forgetting map\n\\[\n    ft_k : {\\mathcal Z}^\\text{uc}_{A,g,k} \\to {\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k-1}.\n\\]\nThe preimage of stable curve in \\({\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k-1}\\) via \\(ft_k\\) can be identified with the underlying Riemann surface with nodes identified, thereby explaining the choice of nomenclature “universal curve”. It is possible to pullback regular perturbations via this map, and hence obtain a well-defined map between perturbed Gromov–Witten moduli spaces.\nNow we find ourselves in the following situation: given the Gromov–Witten moduli space \\(\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}_{A,g,k}\\) we can define polyfold Gromov–Witten invariants associated to the usual Gromov–Witten polyfold \\({\\mathcal Z}_{A,g,k}\\) and associated to the universal curve polyfold \\({\\mathcal Z}^\\text{uc}_{A,g,k}\\) which, a priori, we cannot assume are equivalent.\nIn (Schmaltz 2019b), I present a general framework for proving that polyfold invariants are natural, which applied to polyfold Gromov–Witten theory yields the following result.\nTheorem. (Schmaltz 2019b, Naturality of the polyfold Gromov–Witten invariants) The polyfold Gromov–Witten invariants are natural, and do not depend on auxiliary choices made in their construction. In particular, the Gromov–Witten invariants associated to the usual Gromov–Witten polyfold and associated to the universal curve Gromov–Witten polyfold are identical."
